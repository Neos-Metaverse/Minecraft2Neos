# Minecraft2Neos
This is source code for the Minecraft importer for Neos VR. Currently this isn't quite officially supported (but Pull Requests for improving support are welcome!), but implemented mostly for fun, but also as a example for making custom importers for Neos and working with its data model. The tooling around this isn't best either right now, but hopefully it'll give a good reference and start for now!

Requires a custom fork of the Substrate library: https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/Substrate
